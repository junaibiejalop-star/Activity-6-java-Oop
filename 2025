Activity-6-Java-OOP
This project is a simple console-based Library Management System written in Java. It allows users to
manage books, borrow and return books, and track transactions. The system also includes an admin 
role for
managing users and the library catalog. Data is stored in text files so information is saved even after the program is closed.
